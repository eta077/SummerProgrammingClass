# Let's Get Started!

* Create and clone a new personal repository
* Create a Rust crate
* Commit local changes
* Push changes to remote

# Variables

* A bit is either 0 or 1. A byte is 8 bits. Bytes are the main unit of information for a computer
* All software is assigning meaning to bytes
* Mutability - can the value be changed after initialization?
* Primitives - boolean (true/false), integer, float, character, string

# Comments and Control Flow

* Comments are just for the human, explaining the motivation for logic flow or documenting an API
* if / else expressions use booleans to determine what happens next in the program
